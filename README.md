# Virtual-Hand-Detection-Mouse
Mouse pointer and click event handled by hand detection model


This project focuses on creating a virtual mouse controller that uses hand detection technology. The system allows users to control their computer cursor and perform mouse actions using hand gestures. By leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques, the controller interprets hand movements to provide an intuitive and contactless way to interact with a computer.

Features
Hand Detection: Utilizes computer vision to detect and track hand gestures.
Mouse Control: Translates hand movements into mouse actions such as moving the cursor, clicking, and scrolling.
Contactless Interface: Provides a touch-free method for controlling the computer.
Requirements
Hardware:

Camera (for hand detection)
Software:

Python
OpenCV
MediaPipe
